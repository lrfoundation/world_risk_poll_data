# World Risk Poll Data
At Lloyd’s Register Foundation, we are committed to the principles of open and accessible data, as it gives the research we fund the best possible chance to have a positive impact on safety.
All World Risk Poll data is freely available to download and use (with attribution). The dataset currently includes all data from the 2019 and 2021 Polls, as well as the data (collected in 2023) for all World Risk Poll 2024 reports published to date. Data associated with future reports will be added to the dataset as and when they are published. We actively encourage third party reuse of this data for secondary analysis to create deeper insights.

With over 20 million datapoints, the World Risk Poll dataset can be a challenging to work with for those who are not data specialists. However, with the interactive World Risk Poll Data Explorer, it is possible to easily identify global or regional trends from all respondents within and across the datasets, or drill down and perform highly focused comparisons at country or demographic levels.
